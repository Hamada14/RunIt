# RunIt
RunIt is an event-driven, serverless computing platform. It is a compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources required by that code. It's also responsible for sand-boxing the running code.

## Running the Application:
Currently running the application is only using `rackup -p #{PORT}`, remember to use the required port.
To access the server use https://0.0.0.0:3000
