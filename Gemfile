# RSpec is a 'Domain Specific Language' (DSL) testing tool written in Ruby to test Ruby code.
# It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in the production
# applications. The basic idea behind this concept is that of Test Driven Development (TDD) where
# the tests are written first and the development is based on writing just enough code that will
# fulfill those tests followed by refactoring. It contains its own mocking framework that is fully
# integrated into #the framework based upon JMock.[5] The simplicity in the RSpec syntax makes
# it one of the popular testing tools for Ruby applications.
